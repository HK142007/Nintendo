## Main differences with JSNES

* Sound button.
* Restart button.
* Audio working in Safari (MacOS and iOS).
* Load and save state working (several bug fixes).
* Mobile compatibility (virtual joystick and buttons).
* Pause and Resume automatically if the window is focused or not.
* It is a Progressive Web App compatible with Android and iOS devices.

## Roadmap

* Remove clipping: The PPU.js file has a ScrollWrite function that implements a 7px clipping.
